## About Me
I'm a security researcher focusing on Web3 security. In a past life I was in R&D, then an entrepreneur, then VP sales of other startups. 

I run private audits (through [Stateless Labs](https://statelesslabs.xyz/)) as well as the ocasional auditing competitions. 

For private audits or security consulting, please reach out to me on Twitter ([@niroh30](https://x.com/niroh30)).
