## About Me
I'm a security researcher focusing on Web3 security. In a past life I held various R&D positions (mostly web2), then transitioned to sales climbing the ladder up to assuming VP sales positions of several Cyber Security startups, more recently decided to transition back to tech - entrepeneured several web3 MEV related projects, and finally landed in web3 security. 

I run private audits (through [Stateless Labs](https://statelesslabs.xyz/)) as well as the ocasional auditing competitions. 

For private audits or security consulting, please reach out to me on Twitter ([@niroh30](https://x.com/niroh30)).

Below are some of my credits:
